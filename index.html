    An alternate method of fuel production has been created in the early 17th century to be called synthetic fuel. Nazi Germany thinks they would use these new methods of fuel production as a strategic advantage to outlast enemies. However, the earlier than planned defeat meant that it was not effective. Undeterred, the United States and South Africa capitalized on the technological advancements until the price of oil causes synthetic fuel to become redundant. Fast forward to the 21st century we have the issue of global warming. Combustion engine cars being one of the many contributors to the problem. Porsche is aiming to develop an environmentally friendly fuel to mitigate the impact of combustion engine emissions and reduce the production of billions of tons of scrap. 
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The era of the combustion engine is approaching its end, or so we thought. Over the past century, we have witnessed the development of alternative fuel sources distinct from traditional fossil fuels such as our diesel and petroleum.
    <br>
     <br>
  </p>
  <h2 id="Early_Development">Early Development</h2>
  <p>
    The discovery of synthetic fuel production remains to be not exactly known. It was alleged that it was first attempted in the 17th century <a href="#runnels-et-al-1952" onclick="scrollToSection('runnels-et-al-1952')">(Runnels et al., 1952)</a>. The first recorded oil-shale farm using the Selligue retorting process was in France in 1838 <a href="#runnels-et-al-1952" onclick="scrollToSection('runnels-et-al-1952')">(Runnels et al., 1952)</a>. Later in 1850, Scotland had an oil-shale operation using the Young process <a href="#runnels-et-al-1952" onclick="scrollToSection('runnels-et-al-1952')">(Runnels et al., 1952)</a>. Furthermore, these oil-shale operations were established in many areas such as: Europe, Asia, Oceania, North America, South America, Africa and the Middle East <a href="#runnels-et-al-1952" onclick="scrollToSection('runnels-et-al-1952')">(Runnels et al., 1952)</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
  <p>
    During both world wars Germany took a big investment of synthetic fuels where Friedrich Bergius, a German scientist, played a vital role in advancing the conversion of coal into synthetic fuel through the Bergius process <a href="#friedrich-bergius-2023" onclick="scrollToSection('friedrich-bergius-2023')">(Encyclopædia Britannica, 2023)</a>. Simultaneously another noteworthy project was the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) (Figure 1), developed by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch <a href="#dry-m-2004" onclick="scrollToSection('dry-m-2004')">(Dry, 2004)</a>.

    <br>
     <p>
    Despite these pioneering efforts, the awareness of the development of synthetic fuels remained relatively quiet due to inefficiencies and high costs. Germany took a significant interest in synthetic fuels to reduce its dependence on petroleum imports <a href="#dry-m-2004" onclick="scrollToSection('dry-m-2004')">(Dry, 2004)</a>. During 1930s, the Nazi party focused its attention on synthetic fuels, as an economic standpoint and in preparation for outrunning any enemies. When Germany lost the war, their enemies banned synthetic fuel production in 1945 throughout the country <a href="#us-dept-state-1945" onclick="scrollToSection('us-dept-state-1945')">(U.S. Department of State, 1945)</a>. This ban led to the dismantling of FTS plants, marking a sudden halt to the industry.
    <br>
     <br>
<h2 id="Post_war_Development">Post war Development</h2>
        <p>
    However, this was not the end for synthetic fuels. Already in the 1930s, South African companies displayed interest in the subject, investing in the construction of FTS plants in South Africa <a href="#hilsenrath-1989" onclick="scrollToSection('hilsenrath-1989')">(Hilsenrath, 1989)</a>. After the war, the United States reignited its archaic enthusiasm for synthetic fuels. 
    <br>
<br>
           <p>
    A milestone for the United States arrived on April 5th, 1944, when Congress approved the Synthetic Fuels Act. This legislation allocated $20 million resulting in the establishment of new laboratories and plant focused on advancing synthetic fuels <a href="#vietor-1980" onclick="scrollToSection('vietor-1980')">(Vietor, 1980)</a>. Progress and innovation continued at a steady but measured pace. During 1980’s in America, when a dramatic drop in oil prices prompted the discontinuation of further synthetic fuel production (Figure 2)<a href="#chartsbin" onclick="scrollToSection('chartsbin')">(ChartsBin, 2014)</a>. Unfortunately, it was abandoned, and it wouldn't survive this time around.

              <p>
    A synthetic fuel is “a liquid or gaseous fuel derived from a source such as coal, shale oil, tar sands, or biomass, used as a substitute for oil or natural gas” <a href="#cleveland-morris-2015" onclick="scrollToSection('cleveland-morris-2015')">(Cleveland & Morris, 2015)</a>. Early production of synthetic fuels was environmentally still damaging as it was just a process of turning coal into products like gas. During the process, toxic gases are created and released into the atmosphere <a href="#dry-m-2004" onclick="scrollToSection('dry-m-2004')">(Dry, 2004)</a>.
                <br>
<br>
                 <p>
    With recent technological advancements have rekindled interest in developing an alternative fuel system for conventional combustion engines that eliminates or dramatically reduces toxic emissions. There are around 1.474 billion cars on the road <a href="#hedges-company" onclick="scrollToSection('hedges-company')">(Hedges Company, 2023)</a>. It is also said that there are around 26 million electric cars on the road <a href="#hedges-company" onclick="scrollToSection('hedges-company')">(Hedges Company, 2023)</a>. Then approximately 1.45 billion combustion engine vehicles could be scrapped and taken off the roads. If electric cars were to replace combustion cars, then would there be enough lithium to make batteries for them? Yet, transport is key to the working of efficient economies.
    <br>
<br>
                    <p>
    Modern synthetic fuels, known as e-fuels, offer a new hope. Porsche has been discreetly testing and developing e-fuels. This innovative fuel could potentially convert any combustion engines carbon dioxide-free with only the need for minor tweaks to the tuning of the car. In mid-2022, a plant in Chile began production of this new fuel <a href="#porsche-2019" onclick="scrollToSection('porsche-2019')">(Porsche, 2019)</a>. The e-fuel production process involves water and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen is generated via electrolysis, employing a direct current to split water molecules. The hydrogen is collected at the cathode, while the anode attracts carbon dioxide. This process, referred to as methanol synthesis, yields e-methanol, which is subsequently transformed into synthetic petrol through another process known as MTG synthesis <a href="#porsche-2019" onclick="scrollToSection('porsche-2019')">(Porsche, 2019)</a>.
    <br>
<br>
                       <p>
    Porsche was determined to be producing around 130,000 litre of e-fuel a year in their new Chile production plant by the end of 2022. They showcased their innovation by fuelling all their pre-1966 911 cars at the 2023 Goodwood Revival Festival <a href="#jupp-2023" onclick="scrollToSection('jupp-2023')">(Jupp, 2023)</a>. Within the automotive industry new automotive ideas and technique are first designed and trialled on racing vehicles. After positive results the new technology trickles down into newly built vehicles that are used by the public. Porsche tested their e-fuels in the 2021 and 2022 seasons of the Porsche Mobil Super Cup, with all participating cars running on their new e-fuel <a href="#exxonmobil-porsche-2021" onclick="scrollToSection('exxonmobil-porsche-2021')">(ExxonMobil, 2021)</a>. Both ExxonMobil and Porsche are working together to advance the progress of biofuels as well as renewable efuels <a href="#exxonmobil-porsche-2021" onclick="scrollToSection('exxonmobil-porsche-2021')">(ExxonMobil, 2021)</a>. This progress shows that we are not far off from having this technology within our everyday cars.
    <br>
<br>
                          <p>
  This is the only hope to save the combustion engine and car fanatics all around the world dread the day that we these magnificent machines will be just trophies in a glass cabinet rarely allowed to be used again. However, if we can get synthetic fuel to be produced at a sufficient rate and then distributed around the world not only could we save billions of tons of scrap but the motors that many of us adore and cherish.
